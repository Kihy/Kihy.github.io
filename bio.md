<h2 id="content">Background</h2>
<p>
Ke obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with first class honours at the University of Canterbury, Chritchurch, New Zealand. He is particularly interested in deep learning algorithms. In particular, the interpretability and security of deep learning in intrusion detection systems.
</p>
<p>
Other than his academic commitments, Ke enjoys a wide range of sports such as basketball, badminton and table tennis. He used to play basketball and table tennis for Burnside High School, and was part of the Table Tennis Canterbury team. Currently he just plays badminton casually on Friday nights. History and Philosophy also interests him. He has travelled around China for approximately one and a half months visiting various museums and historical sites to broaden his knowledge. He is also very keen on Chinese Caligraphy practices it on a daily basis.

		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
		<p>During my Bachelors degree, I have utilised holiday breaks to enhance my skills and knowledge via internships at various companies:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Voluntary Software Assistant @ <i>Enatel ltd.</i></dt>
			<dd><p>Generating summary statistics and graphs in Excel format with raw CSV input file using Python.</p></dd>

			<dt>Software Intern @ <i>Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Supervision Co., Ltd.</i></dt>
			<dd><p>Produced a Multinominal Bayes Classifier to classify faults given a description of the fault. The classifier was trained and evaluated in python with sklearn package. The program has to be integrated into a Java application, so another web service accessed via a simple REST API calls was written in python to make the integration easier.
			Had some time left so a file uploading module was written in Javaâ€™s Spring framework for their image detection team.
			</p></dd>

			<dt>Summer Scholarship Recipient @ <i>University of Canterbury,</i></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>The UC Dependability and Security Lab have developed a Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (HARM), and a plugin was written to calculate risk based on Bayesian networks. This project was supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dsteam/home">Dongseong Kim</a>.
			</p></dd>

			<dt>Software Intern @ <i>Zhejiang Huayun Electric Power Engineering Supervision Co., Ltd.</i></dt>
			<dd>
			<p>Worked as part of the image processing team, working on object detection of helmet-less workers on construction sites. The project is on-going and multiple CNN architectures have been trialed and used, such as YOLO, PVAnet, RetinaNet, etc.
